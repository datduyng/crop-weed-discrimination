# Overview 
###### Goal: 
- Design a robust and simple to integrate plants and weeds machine learning model. 
- Proposes plants/weeds discriminant model that are able to process in real time. 

###### Why? 
- Machine learning vision is wide area of research. Farmers are lying on big industrial camera and machine to discriminate weeds and crops. My vision is to create a within budget and scalable products.
