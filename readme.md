# Overview 
###### Goal: 
- Design a robust and simple to integrate plants and weeds machine learning model. 
- Proposes plants/weeds discriminant model that are able to process in real time. 

###### Why? 
- Machine learning vision is wide area of research. Automated Crops and weed control will save cost and reduce environment impact. 


## Working Flowchart

## Model break down
- Determine plant coordinate in input images/video
	- [Plant blob coordinate](./experiment/Plants-weeds-blob-detection.ipynb)
- [Preprocessing and get Familiar with Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datduyn/preprocessing-plants-weeds-data-model/)
    - `10%` of Dataset is `testset `
- Problem: 
    - limited dataset. with roughly `10,000` more images each model below will achieve `7.5 - 15%` more
